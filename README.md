# spring-security-explained
A live tutorial explaining the basic architecture of Spring Security.

Just follow each unit represented by a Java class, read the content in JavaDoc
and run the live example, you should have a grasp of how Spring Security works.

The official reference tries to cover everything about Spring Security.
There is nothing wrong about it. It is the reference after all. However beginners
usually take longer than they should to learn the basics by reading the reference.
I was one of them.

This tutorial is aimed to be a complement to the official Spring Security
Reference. It only covers the essential parts of Spring Security and focuses on
explaining the correlation among the major components and how each component takes part
in the authentication and authorization flow.
